# Day2 Operations

This section walks us through the key considerations that need to be taken into account when thinking about how to operate AKS after everything is provisioned and running. In this section we will cover the following topic:

- GitOps
- Upgrading Your Cluster
- Resource Management
- Scaling
  - Cluster Scaling
  - Application Scaling
- Daily Monitoring
- Logging
- Alerting
- Backup/DR

We will implement some of the topics throughout this lab where others we will talk about the different approaches you can use for day 2 Operations.

## GitOps

## Resource Management

One of the important task of day 2 operations is resource management. Resource Management consist of maintaining adequate resources to serve your workloads. Kubernetes provides built in mechanisms to provide both soft and hard limits on deployed workloads.
